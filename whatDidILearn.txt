- add variables to "export class <component>" in the component's typescript file to make them available in the component's html file

- string interpolation (i.e. the {{serverId}} part) works as long as the stuff inside the curly brackets can be resolved into a string.
    numbers, strings, methods, terneary exp can be placed inside {{}}, but multi-line logic like if statements aren't allowed
