**      Directives - Deep Dive     **
*************************************

why is the second directive better?
Because it uses 'renderer'. Angular is not restricted to running in the DOM. It can also work with service workers
which are environments where you might not have access to the DOM. Therefore basic highlight, which tries to change the DOM,
won't work

this.renderer.setStyle(this.elRef.nativeElement, 'background-color', 'green');

.setStyle() takes following arguments:
1) element for which you want to set the style
2) style you wanna set
3) value of style
4) flags (eg. !important)
