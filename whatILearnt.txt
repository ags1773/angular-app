**    Services - Dependancy Injection   **
******************************************

The 'account' component depends on the LoggingService class, as it uses the method from it.
Angular's dependancy injector is used to inject an instance of the LoggingService class into our component.

To do so, we must have following things:
1) constructor(private loggingSrv: LoggingService) {} --> tells angular that we need an instance of the class LoggingService
2) providers: [LoggingService]  --> tells angular how to create the service

One of the advantages of DI is that this lets us stay in angular's ecosystem
