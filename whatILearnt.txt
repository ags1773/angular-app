**      Directives - Deep Dive     **
*************************************

Directives are of two types:
  1) Attribute Directives (ngClass, ngStyle ...) - only change properties of the element
  2) Structural Directives (*ngFor and *ngIf) - adds/removes the element from the DOM

### Both *ngFor and *ngIf can't be placed on the same component
