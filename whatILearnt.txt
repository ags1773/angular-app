********************************************
**  Using Services in our recipes projekt **
********************************************

We have used two services:
  1) RecipesService - provided in recipes.component.ts
  2) ShoppingListService - provided in app.module.ts

getAllRecipes(){
  return RECIPES.slice();   -----> this returns a copy of the RECIPES array, so that we don't accidently mess it up
}

As getShoppingList() displays only a copy of the shoppingList, when we add a new ingredient to the shoppingList we can't
expect to see the changed shopping list.

Solution is either to

        getShoppingList(){
          return ShoppingList;
        }

instead of

        getShoppingList(){
          return ShoppingList.slice();
        }

but a BETTER SOLUTION is to emit an event (ingredientsChanged) whenever we add a new ingredient to the shopping list and
subscribe to it in the shopping-list.component.ts file.
