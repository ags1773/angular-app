View encapsulation - Fancy way of saying css styles applied to one component stay applied for that component and don't
    get applied to it's child components, unless told

Angular does this by assigning an attribute to every html element of a component.

eg. in app.component.html, Angular will give each HTML element an attribute '_ngcontent-c1'
    then, all styles will be applied using that attribute
    p[_ngcontent-c1]{
      color: blue;
    }
    form[_ngcontent-c1]{
      margin-right: 0;
    }
This CSS wont be applied to any other components as that component's assigned attribute will be different
unless ViewEncapsulation.None is set for it

import{ ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core'

@Component({
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated   //None, Native
})

'ViewEncapsulation.None' removes addition of the attribute, so CSS styling will trickle down to child components
