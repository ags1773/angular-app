Directives - ngStyle

background Color of para changes using ngStyle based on whether server is online or offline.
Server status (online/offline) is decided randomly

We're using [ngStyle] i.e. we are using property binding '[]' on this directive to dynamically change its value
[ngStyle] = "{'background-color':'red'}"
[ngStyle] = "{backgroundColor:'red'}" .....Both are valid

note there's no '*' prefix like *ngIf because ngStyle doesn't add/remove the <p> element line ngIf

constructor() is a built-in typescript method each typescript class has, which is called when the component is created
