ViewChild method to access HTML in .ts 

Using ViewChild decorator, we can directly get access to DOM elements from within typesctipt file (i.e. without passing local
reference as function parameter as we did previously)

import ViewChild from @angular/core

@ViewChild('serverContentInput') --> serverContentInput is the local reference on the target HTML component in the DOM
@ViewChild(app-cockpit) --> this too will work, it now targets the 1st occurance of <app-cockpit> HTML tag

@ViewChild('serverContentInput') serverContentInput: ElementRef; --> now, we can access the HTML element targeted by the local
reference '#serverContentInput' via the 'serverContentInput' property.
Note that 'ElementRef' too needs to be imported from @angular/core. It's an angular type.

console.log(this.serverContentInput.nativeElement.value); --> will give its value

**IMP**
Do Not set values of HTML elements using ViewChild method, for eg.
this.serverContentInput.nativeElement.value = "Something"
although it'll work, it isn't a good practice
