**      Directives - Deep Dive     **
*************************************

Adding jquery and bootstrap scripts to an angular project isn't recommended.

Goal: make dropdown in recipe-detail component and navbar work without using bootstrap.js and jquery

Note: The tutorial uses bootstrap 3, in which adding/removing class "open" on the button element itself makes the dropdown
  work. However, in bootstrap 4, it works differently

How to :
- Although not recommended, adding class "show" to class "dropdown-menu" of a dropdown opens it; removing
  it closes the dropdown
- Create a custom directive, make it listen to click event on class "dropdown-toggle" and toggle class "show"
  on class "dropdown-menu"

In the current form, I'm able to add class 'show' to the button itself on which the directive is placed; but I can't
figure out how to add/remove the class on a different element. Therefore the dropdowns aren't working currently!
