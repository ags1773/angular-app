**    Injecting service into another service  **
************************************************

app.module.ts file is the topmost level where we can inject a service. Inject it here and the service will be available everywhere

here, we have
1) Injected AccountsService in app.module and removed the providers[AccountsService] from everywhere else, so same instance
    of AccountsService is passed to all
2) Removed LoggingService from everywhere altogether and placed it inside the AccountsService


** Putting LoggingService Inside AccountsService **
1) provide 'LoggingService' in app.module
2) inside the AccountsService, import LoggingService and add it's constructor
3) add @Injectable() decorator.
      This needs to be added to the component in which we want to inject a second component
      It's basically metadata that tells angular to inject LoggingService into the AccountsService
