Passing data with Event Binding

html input element is bound to onUpdateServerName($event) method. $event is a reserved angular keyword, contains lots of
things, one of which is the user's input.

"event.target.value" i.e. the typed input, is assigned to "serverName" property, and it is displayed using string interpolation.

NOTE: This is NOT two-way data binding
