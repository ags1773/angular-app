Two-way data binding

Client Side: <input> element
Server side: "serverName" variable

change value of either, and it updates the other part. This is two-way data binding.

In order to use two way data binding, we need "ngModel". Add following to app.module.ts file:
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
add "FormsModule" to imports array
